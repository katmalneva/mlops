# Clothing value prediction (MLOps)

Predict clothing resale value using sold-listing data. The repo now includes:

- a scraper-aligned raw/bronze/silver data pipeline
- MLflow-backed training and model registration
- a FastAPI prediction service for the deployment milestone

## Quick start

```bash
cd mlops
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .
```

Build the sample sold-listings dataset:

```bash
python scripts/build_sample_dataset.py
```

Train and log a baseline model to MLflow:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

Browse experiments in the UI:

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:./mlruns
```

## Run the API locally

The service loads the model from the local MLflow Model Registry in `./mlruns` by default. If
you have already trained the baseline model in this repo, the latest registered version is loaded
from `models:/clothing-value-model/latest`.

Start the API:

```bash
export MLFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_URI="models:/clothing-value-model/latest"
uvicorn clothing_mlops.service:app --reload
```

If you are working only with a local run artifact before registry setup, you can override the URI
with a direct run-based model URI.

Verify the required milestone endpoints in another terminal:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brand": "Patagonia",
    "category": "Jacket",
    "size": "M",
    "condition": "used_very_good",
    "color": "Blue",
    "material": "Polyester",
    "listing_price": 129.0,
    "shipping_price": 12.5
  }'
```

## Configuration

| Env var | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` | Defaults to `file:<repo>/mlruns`. Set to a remote server when you have one. |
| `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME` | Defaults to `item-value-prediction`. |
| `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME` | Model Registry name used by the service. Defaults to `clothing-value-model`. |
| `MLFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_URI` | Explicit model URI for the service, such as `models:/clothing-value-model/latest`. |

## Data pipeline

The ingestion side of the project is organized into three layers:

- `data/raw/`: one HTML snapshot per listing plus a manifest
- `data/bronze/`: parsed sold-listing records
- `data/silver/`: normalized training dataset and summary metadata

Each record includes traceability fields such as `listing_id`, `source_url`, `scrape_timestamp`, `parser_version`, and `sold_date`.

To test against a manually saved eBay item page without hitting the live site:

```bash
python scripts/parse_saved_ebay_html.py "/absolute/path/to/item.html"
```

This emits one normalized JSON record extracted from the saved HTML, using page metadata, structured product schema, and visible item details.

To download a batch of generic HTML pages from a URL list into a local folder:

```bash
python scripts/download_html_pages.py urls.txt --output-dir data/raw/downloads
```

Where `urls.txt` contains one URL per line. The script saves each HTML file plus `download_manifest.csv` with status and output path.

## API endpoints

The FastAPI service exposes the milestone endpoints:

- `GET /` returns a welcome payload and example request body
- `GET /health` confirms whether the MLflow model loaded successfully
- `POST /predict` validates input with Pydantic and returns a predicted sale price

Example request:

```json
{
  "brand": "Patagonia",
  "category": "Jacket",
  "size": "M",
  "condition": "used_very_good",
  "color": "Blue",
  "material": "Polyester",
  "listing_price": 129.0,
  "shipping_price": 12.5
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "predicted_sale_price": 126.13,
  "model_status": "ok"
}
```

## Docker

Build and run the API container locally:

```bash
docker build -t clothing-value-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/mlruns:/app/mlruns" \
  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="file:/app/mlruns" \
  -e MLFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_URI="models:/clothing-value-model/latest" \
  clothing-value-api
```

Published Docker Hub image:

```bash
aidanpercy/clothing-value-api:latest
```

To publish the image to Docker Hub, tag and push the local image using the same published image
name:

```bash
docker login
docker tag clothing-value-api aidanpercy/clothing-value-api:latest
docker push aidanpercy/clothing-value-api:latest
```

To run the already-published image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/mlruns:/app/mlruns" \
  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="file:/app/mlruns" \
  -e MLFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_URI="models:/clothing-value-model/latest" \
  aidanpercy/clothing-value-api:latest
```

Use the same published image name in your report, screenshot, and submission PDF.

## Milestone submission checklist

Include the following in your submission PDF:

1. GitHub repository link for the full project
2. Direct link to the endpoint definitions in `src/clothing_mlops/service.py`
3. Screenshot of the published Docker image in Docker Hub (or another artifact registry)
4. Brief run instructions summary, with this README as the full source of commands
5. Example `/predict` request and response format

## Project flow

1. Build raw/bronze/silver sold-listings artifacts with `python scripts/build_sample_dataset.py`
2. Train a baseline model and log it to MLflow with `python scripts/train_model.py`
3. Register or reference the trained model in MLflow
4. Serve predictions through FastAPI and package the service with Docker

`mlruns/` is gitignored; commit code and configs, not local run stores (or export to a shared tracking server for the team).
